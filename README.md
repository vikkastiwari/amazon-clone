### 4. Setup firebase for development (optional)

A firebase account is already created, but you will not have the access to it.

- To use your own firebase instance, create a new firebase project using [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- After creating a project, go to [project settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/).
- In project settings of your newly created project there will be a section called 'Your Apps' which says 'There are no apps in your project, Select a platform to get started.' 
- Click on the 'WebApp' Icon, then it will ask to register a new App.

- In the 2nd step of app registration, firebase will provide to you the firebase credentials of your app.
- Now change it to provide your firebase credentials [here](https://github.com/codeforcauseorg/Code-for-cause-Leaders/blob/master/src/services/authService.js#L8-LL13)

Your application setup is successfully completed!
